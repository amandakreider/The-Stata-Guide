### Have questions?

Hop in the [The Code Block](https://discord.gg/x6VGAXay) Discord server and ask your questions!

I get a lot of e-mails with code and data files and now it is hard to keep track on who is requesting what. At least in Discord several people can answer your questions. This also helps document the problems for other people.




### How can you support the guides?

These guides are meant as a public service and I really enjoy writing them, and getting feedback from you guys. 

But if you want to support the content creation, then you can:


(a) become a member on [Medium](https://medium.com) and subscribe and read the guides. This also gives you access to a lot of other awesome content as well.

or 

(b) make some small donation via PayPal (several people ask for this so I set it up):

These options are completely optional :)
