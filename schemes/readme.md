In this folder are various new Stata schemes. The schemes have been programmed in three flavors: white, black, and ggplot. As the names suggest, these are the background colors.

Each scheme has a colorscheme name in front of it. These schemes can be installed as follows:



A test dataset together with the script is also provided to test the graphs. The XXX.dofile contains the following code:

Sample graphs are in the /graphs/ folder. A few examples are given below.

These schemes are procedurally generated where the colors and other information is introduced in the scheme via scripts. The core white scheme is based on the Cleanplots theme (XX) that is itself derived from the plainplots theme (Bischof 2017). Most of the elements have been overwritten but the simple structure of the dotted grid lines and the axis colors is maintained. I really like it!
